    Photography is picture language, the newest version of the oldest form of graphic communication. Unlike the spoken or written
     word, it is a form of communication that can be internationally understood. This, it seems to me, gives a photograph added 
     meaning-and a photographer added responsibility. Since photographs can be so widely understood we should be concerned with 
     whether what we have to say is worth saying, and whether we can say it well.

    The essential purpose of photography is communication. Few people take pictures solely to please themselves. Most of us take 
    them because we want them seen by others. We wish or are compelled to inform, educate, entertain, reform, or share some
     experienced with others. Pictures are a photographer's means of expression as a writer's means are words. And as a writer
      must choose a major field of work -journalism, creative writing, biography, advertising, etc. So a photographer must choose 
      a specific field, each field having a specific purpose.
