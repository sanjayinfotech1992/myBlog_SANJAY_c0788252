    Business and management academics have traditionally drawn a distinction between leadership and management roles. Leaders of projects and/or teams, they say, define and convey the overall vision of what can be achieved, inspiring other team members to bring their best to the team. Managers, meanwhile, ensure that ‘things get done’; they define the individual tasks that need to be completed, set the required standards and timeframes, monitor performance and budgets, and enable each team member to perform at their best.
